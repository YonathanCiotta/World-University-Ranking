# World-University-Ranking

Enhancing Predictive Models for World University Rankings
This repository contains code and resources for enhancing predictive models used in world university rankings. The project focuses on improving the accuracy and reliability of rankings based on key metrics such as publications, quality of education, and influence.

Key Objectives
Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Comprehensive data cleaning and normalization to ensure data quality and reduce bias.

Feature Engineering: Incorporation of additional relevant features and exploration of non-linear relationships to capture the complexity of university rankings.

Model Development: Implementation and optimization of machine learning models, including regularized linear models and ensemble methods, to enhance predictive accuracy.

Validation and Deployment: Validation of models using rigorous evaluation techniques such as cross-validation, and deployment for public access and feedback.
